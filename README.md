# C3_Project_ANIRUDDHA

Added all three commits one by one in Local Repository and then added whole thing to this remote repository with git push at once. 
Unsure whether this was to be added after each commit. Anyway, I've completed the assignment with best of my knowledge gained so far as a fresher. 
Did not write Failure test case of Part:3 as it is written "fail case scenario/Exception scenario would be unnecessary" in the section of "Part 3: Adding a Feature using TDD", to be honest I was also not sure what is to be written as Fail test case in part 3. Waiting for your kind feedback.
